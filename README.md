# CHIP-8 IDE

Welcome to the CHIP-8 IDE repository! This project provides a robust development environment for coding, testing, and debugging CHIP-8 programs efficiently. Built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, this IDE is designed to enhance the development experience for CHIP-8 enthusiasts and developers.

## Access the CHIP-8 IDE
You can access and use the CHIP-8 IDE directly [here](https://wojlin.github.io/chip8-ide/).

## Description
The CHIP-8 IDE simplifies the creation and testing of CHIP-8 programs. It features real-time syntax highlighting, a step-by-step debugger, and seamless integration with CHIP-8 emulators for instant testing. Export your projects as binary files or generate Markdown documentation directly from your codebase. Interactive comments and annotations dynamically update to reflect binary operations, aiding in code comprehension and collaboration.

## Technologies Used
- **JavaScript**: Powers the core functionality and logic of the IDE, including the emulator integration and debugger.
- **HTML**: Provides the structure and layout for the user interface, ensuring accessibility and responsiveness.
- **CSS**: Styles the IDE for an intuitive and visually appealing user experience.

## What is CHIP-8?
CHIP-8 is an interpreted programming language developed in the mid-1970s for early microcomputers. It was used primarily for game development and educational purposes. CHIP-8 programs run on a virtual machine, which has been implemented on various platforms over the years due to its simplicity and nostalgic appeal.

## Key Features
- **Effortless Coding**: Write and edit CHIP-8 programs with real-time syntax highlighting.
- **Comprehensive Debugger**: Step through code execution with real-time updates on register values and memory.
- **Versatile File Handling**: Export programs as binaries or generate Markdown documentation.
- **Interactive Comments**: Dynamic comments reflect the corresponding binary operations, enhancing code understanding.
- **Responsive UI**: Adapts to different screen sizes and user preferences for optimal usability.
